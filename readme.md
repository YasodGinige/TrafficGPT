In this repository, we guide you in setting up the TrafficGPT project in a local environment and reproducing the results. TrafficGPT, a novel traffic analysis attack that leverages GPT-2, a popular LLM, to enhance feature extraction, thereby improving
the open-set performance of downstream classification. We use five existing encrypted traffic datasets to show how the feature extraction by GPT-2 improves the open-set performance of traffic
analysis attacks. As the open-set classification methods, we use K-LND, OpenMax, and Backgroundclass methods, and shows that K-LND methods have higher performance overall.
